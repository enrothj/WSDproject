This is my project submission for the Aalto University course CS-3170 Web Software Development. It got a grade of 63/64.

The web application was made using the guidelines of the course. It uses the Deno runtime, along with the Oak framework. Due to a lack of time, I did not implement 
automated tests or deploy it online. It also lacks any CSS, so the look is very barebones aside from the Bootstrap stylesheet.
