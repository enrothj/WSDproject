Course Project (copied 8.12.2020)

Overview

In the course project, you will build a web application for self-monitoring purposes. The application provides users an opportunity to report behavior daily.

Reported content

The behavior reported to the application are as follows:

    Sleep duration and sleep quality
    Time spent on sports and exercise
    Time spent studying
    Regularity and quality of eating
    Generic mood

When the application is opened (and the user has logged in), the application provides two options for reporting: morning and evening.

    When choosing morning, the application asks for the sleep duration and sleep quality, as well as generic mood. Sleep duration is given as a decimal indicating hours slept, and sleep quality and generic mood are given using a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates very poor and 5 indicates excellent.

    When choosing evening, the application asks for time spent on sports and exercise, time spent studying, regularity and quality of eating, and generic mood. Time spent on sports and exercise, and time spent studying are given as a decimal number indicating the number of hours. Regularity and quality of eating as well as the generic mood are given using a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates very poor and 5 indicates excellent.

In both options, by default, the application assumes that the reporting is done for the current day (or, in the case of the morning, for the previous night). Both reporting options should also provide an input field through which a different day can be chosen -- this way, if a user skips reporting, the data can be filled in at a later point.

Summarization

The application provides functionality for summarization of responses. Each user can view statistics of their reports on a weekly and monthly level. These statistics are as follows.

    Average sleep duration
    Average time spent on sports and exercise
    Average time spent studying
    Average sleep quality
    Average generic mood

High-level summaries generated from all the users of the application are shown both on the landing page of the application and provided through an API.

Schedule

The deadline for the project is on 11th of December. After the project has been submitted, it will be reviewed by other course participants. Reviews will begin on the 12th of December and must be completed by 18th of December.

Returning the project

Returning the project is done by returning a zip file that contains the project source code. The zip file should contain also instructions for running the project, necessary CREATE TABLE statements, required configurations, an internet address where the application can be tried out, and any other documentation laid out in the more detailed checklist below.

When returning the project, you will use a version of the checklist to specify which requirements were completed.

Reviewing the projects

Details announced later.

Steps to get started

Here is a possible list of steps that can be taken to get started with the application. Consider writing tests throughout the project and consider using a version control system (e.g. a private repository on GitHub for the project). For specific requirements, refer to the (epic) checklist below.

    Create a folder structure for the project (following the one outlined in "Structuring Web Applications"). Add files 'app.js' and 'deps.js' to the project.
    Create a database for the project and add necessary files (configuration, database query functionality) to the project. Based on your interpretation of the requirements, create a database schema. Do not fixate on this schema, and assume that you might change it later on. Also, consider the possibility of feeding in data to the database from the command line / from an online browser for testing purposes.
    Add some middlewares to the project, at least an error reporting middleware.
    Add functionality for reporting (morning) behavior. When adding reports, use a fixed user id (e.g. 1).
    Add functionality for summarization of individual responses on a weekly level, now focusing on a single (last?) week. When building reports, use a fixed user id (e.g. 1).
    Create the landing page that shows the average mood from today and yesterday. Add a note on trend (i.e. going up / down).
    Add functionality for reporting (evening) behavior. When adding reports, use a fixed user id (e.g. 1).
    Adjust summarization of individual responses to include the reported evening behavior. Continue using a fixed user id (e.g. 1).
    Add monthly summarization functionality and implement the possibility to select a week and / or a month.
    Implement registration and authentication functionality. Change the fixed user id to that of the user in the session.
    Add styles using a library.
    Clean up and document.
    Implement APIs
    Continue working on missing content.

Epic checklist

A more detailed checklist is shown below. We suggest storing intermediate versions of the project in a private GitHub repository or similar. When checking for completed requirements in grading, each of the following bullet counts as one requirement. Deviation from individual requirements is possible, given that they are documented.

    Application structure
        1Application divided into logical folders (akin to the part on Structuring Web Applications)
        2Dependencies exported from deps.js
        3Project launched from app.js, which is in the root folder
        4Configurations in a separate folder (e.g. config)
            Test configurations separate from production configurations
            Configurations loaded from environmental variables or e.g. dotenv -files

    Users
        5Email and password stored in the database for each user
            Password not stored in plaintext format
            Emails must be unique (same email cannot be stored twice in the database)
        6Users can register to the application
        7Registration form is accessible at /auth/registration
            Registration uses labels to clarify the purpose of the input fields
            Registration form is validated on the server
                Email must be a valid email (clarified from before, i.e. email must be validated - no need to e.g. send a mail to the address though)
                Password must contain at least 4 characters
                Validation errors shown on page
                In case of validation errors, email field is populated (password is not)
        8User-specific functionality is structured into logical parts (e.g. userController.js, userService.js)

    Authentication
        9Application uses session-based authentication
        10Login form is accessible at /auth/login
            Login form asks for email and password
            Login uses labels to clarify the purpose of the input fields
            Login form has a link to the registration form
            If the user types in an invalid email or password, a message "Invalid email or password" is shown on the login page.
                Form fields are not populated
        11Authentication functionality is structured into logical parts (e.g. authController.js or part of userController.js, ...).
        12Application has a logout button that allows the user to logout (logging out effectively means clearing the session)
            Logout functionality is at /auth/logout

    Middleware
        13The application has middleware that logs all the errors that occurred within the application
        14The application has middleware that logs all requests made to the application
            Logged information contains current time, request method, requested path, and user id (or anonymous if not authenticated)
        15The application has middleware that controls access to the application
            Landing page at / is accessible to all
            Paths starting with /api are accessible to all
            Paths starting with /auth are accessible to all
            Other paths require that the user is authenticated
                Non-authenticated users are redirected to the login form at /auth/login
        16Application has middleware that controls access to static files
            Static files are placed under /static
        17Middleware functionality is structured into logical parts (e.g. separate middlewares folder).

    Reporting

        18Reporting functionality is available under the path /behavior/reporting

        19Reporting cannot be done if the user is not authenticated

        20When accessing /behavior/reporting, user can choose whether morning or evening is being reported
            User reporting form depends on selection
            Page at /behavior/reporting shows whether morning and/or evening reporting for today has already been done

        21Morning reporting form contains fields for date, sleep duration, sleep quality, and generic mood
            Date is populated by default to today, but can be changed
                Form has a date field for selecting the date
            Sleep duration is reported in hours (with decimals)
            Sleep quality and generic mood are reported using a number from 1 to 5, where 1 corresponds to very poor and 5 corresponds to excellent.
                Form has a slider (e.g. range) or radio buttons for reporting the value
            Form contains labels that clarify the purpose of the input fields and the accepted values
            Form fields are validated
                Sleep duration must be entered, must be a number (can be decimal), and cannot be negative
                Sleep quality and generic mood must be reported using numbers between 1 and 5 (integers).
                In case of validation errors, form fields are populated

        22Evening reporting form contains fields for date, time spent on sports and exercise, time spent studying, regularity and quality of eating, and generic mood
            Date is populated by default to today, but can be changed
                Form has a date field for selecting the date
            Time spent on sports and exercise and time spent studying are reported in hours (with decimals)
            Regularity and quality of eating and generic mood are reported using a number from 1 to 5, where 1 corresponds to very poor and 5 corresponds to excellent.
                Form has a slider (e.g. range) or radio buttons for reporting the value
            Form contains labels that clarify the purpose of the input fields and the accepted values
            Form fields are validated
                Time spent on sports and exercise and time spent studying are reported in hours must be entered, must be a number (can be decimal), and cannot be negative
                Regularity and quality of eating and generic mood must be reported using numbers between 1 and 5 (integers).
                In case of validation errors, form fields are populated

        23Reported values are stored into the database
            The database schema used for reporting works for the task
            Reporting is user-specific (all reported values are stored under the currently authenticated user)
            If the same report is already given (e.g. morning report for a specific day), then the older report is removed
                If the functionality for handling duplicate reports is something else, the functionality is described in documentation

        24Reporting functionality structured into logical parts (separate views folder, separate controller for reporting, service(s), ...)

    Summarization
        26Summary functionality is available under the path /behavior/summary
        27Main summary page contains the following statistics, by default shown for the last week and month
            Weekly average (by default from last week)
                Average sleep duration
                Average time spent on sports and exercise
                Average time spent studying
                Average sleep quality
                Average generic mood
            Monthly average (by default from last month)
                Average sleep duration
                Average time spent on sports and exercise
                Average time spent studying
                Average sleep quality
                Average generic mood
        28Summary page has a selector for week and month. Check input type="week" and input type="month".
            When the week is changed, the weekly average will be shown for the given week.
            When the month is changed, the monthly average will be shown for the given month.
            If no data for the given week exists, the weekly summary shows text suggesting that no data for the given week exists.
            If no data for the given month exists, the monthly summary shows text suggesting that no data for the given month exists.
        29Summary data / averages calculated within the database
            When doing weekly reporting, the weekly averages are calculated in the database
            When doing monthly reporting, the monthly averages are calculated in the database
        30Summarization page contains statistics only for the current user.

    Landing page (i.e. page at the root path of the application)
        31Landing page briefly describes the purpose of the application
        32Landing page shows a glimpse at the data and indicates a trend
            Landing page shows users' average mood for today and and yesterday
            If the average mood yesterday was better than today, tells that things are looking gloomy today
            If the average mood yesterday was was worse today, tells that things are looking bright today
        33Landing page has links / buttons for login and register functionality
        34Landing page has links / buttons for reporting functionality

    Testing
        35The application has at least 5 meaningful automated tests. All tests detect if e.g. tested functionality is changed so that it no longer works as expected.
        36The application has at least 10 meaningful automated tests. All tests detect if e.g. tested functionality is changed so that it no longer works as expected.
        37The application has at least 15 meaningful automated tests. All tests detect if e.g. tested functionality is changed so that it no longer works as expected.
        38The application has at least 20 meaningful automated tests. All tests detect if e.g. tested functionality is changed so that it no longer works as expected.

    Security
        39Passwords are not stored in plaintext
        40Field types in the database match the actual content (i.e., when storing numbers, use numeric types)
        41Database queries done using parameterized queries (i.e., code cannot be injected to SQL queries)
        42Data retrieved from the database are sanitized (i.e., if showing content from database, using <%= ... %> instead of <%- ...%> unless explicitly stated what for).
        43Users cannot access data of other users.
        44Users cannot post reports to other users' accounts.

    Database
        45Expensive calculations such as calculating averages are done in the database
        46Indices are used when joining tables if the queries are such that they are used often
        47Database uses a connection pool
        48Database credentials are not included in the code

    User interface / views
        49Views are stored in a separate folder
        50User interface uses partials for header content
        51User interface uses partials for footer content
        52Recurring parts are separated into own partials (e.g. partial for validation errors)
        53Pages with forms contain functionality that guides the user
            Labels are shown next to form fields so that the user knows what to enter to the form fields
            Form fields are validated and user sees validation errors close to the form fields
            In the case of validation errors, form fields are populated (with the exception of the login page)
        54User interface uses a style library or self-made stylesheets (see e.g. Twitter Bootstrap for a style library)
            If Twitter Bootstrap or other external style libraries are used, they are used over a content delivery network
        55Different pages of the application follow the same style
        56User sees if the user has logged in (e.g. with a message 'Logged in as my@email.net' shown at the top of the page)

    APIs
        57The application provides an API endpoint for retrieving summary data generated over all users in a JSON format
        58The API is accessible by all
        59The API allows cross-origin requests
        60Endpoint /api/summary provides a JSON document with sleep duration, time spent on sports and exercise, time spent studying, sleep quality, and generic mood averaged over the last 7 days
        61Endpoint /api/summary/:year/:month/:day provides a JSON document with averages for sleep duration, time spent on sports and exercise, time spent studying, sleep quality, and generic mood for the given day

    Deployment
        62Application is available and working in an online location (e.g. Heroku) at an address provided in the documentation
        63Application can be run locally following the guidelines in documentation

    Documentation
        64Documentation contains necessary CREATE TABLE statements needed to create the database used by the application
        65Documentation contains the address at which the application can currently be accessed
        66Documentation contains guidelines for running the application
        67Documentation contains guidelines for running tests

Minimum 70% of requirements is 0.7*67=46.9 => 47? (calculated on 8.12. data)

Note that when you return the project, the project must contain a web application that can be started locally, given that the user follows the given documentation (e.g. a creates required database, sets database credentials). That is, when prioritizing work, you must not sacrifice a working application over individual features from the checklist.

Frequently asked questions

    Q: The project seems quite large, [question]? A: The requirements are long, for sure, but in part this is due to the requirements being written in a way where we've tried to be as explicit as possible. If there are unclarities, get in touch in the course slack. When you start to work on the project, think that you are building a minimum viable product. We recommend that starting with two tables, one for users, and one for reported data, and create the first form for morning reporting -- no need to, e.g., have separate tables for each reported activity.

    Q: Could we postpone the project deadline? A: No. This would influence the schedules of all course participants, many of whom have planned their schedules based on the deadlines announced at the beginning of the course.

    Q: The above checklist is epic. What constitutes as a requirement? A: Great question! We consider each 2nd level item a requirement. For example, in Application structure, there would be four requirements and for the fourth requirement, there would be two clarifications (note that for the R4 below, if you use environmental variables, there is in practice no need to separate test configurations from production configurations):
        R1: Application divided into logical folders (akin to the part on Structuring Web Applications)
        R2: Dependencies exported from deps.js
        R3: Project launched from app.js, which is in the root folder
        R4: Configurations in a separate folder (e.g. config)
            Test configurations separate from production configurations
            Configurations loaded from environmental variables or e.g. dotenv -files

    Q: Could I use language X or framework Y for doing the project, even though they haven't been introduced in the course? A: No. For the project, use the tools that we have used in the course. There is also the review phase in which others will study your project and read your code, learning about reviewing during the process. Let's not create a situation where doing the reviews would require knowledge of other frameworks.

    Q: Are the regularity and quality of eating two separate metrics or one combined metric? A: They are one combined metric (but, if you wish, you can handle them also separately).

    Q: Is there a reason as to why we're not supposed to show the regularity and quality of eating in the summary data? Can we still include it for the sake of completeness, even if it isn't outlined in the project description? A: Well spotted! Our intention was to have them also in the summary data, but didn't spot them missing even with careful proofreading. You can absolutely add them into the summary data, although at this point we won't add them to the requirements.

    Q: Where do we return the project? A: Thanks for being eager about this! We'll add the return for below soon. Sorry to keep you waiting!

    Q: The requirements contain a statement that there should be a middleware that logs application errors. Does this also mean validation errors? A: No need to log validation errors, just log errors that occur due to issues with code etc (check out errorMiddleware from the materials).

    Q: How do I test controllers that do redirections in superoak? A: Unfortunately, this is not currently possible to do in superoak. In later versions of the course, we'll add content on other approaches for testing.

    Q: Regarding the summary for the past month and past week, should we consider this in terms of calendar month or week, or is last 30 days and last 7 days sufficient? A: This hasn't been defined explicitly, so both options are ok.

    Q: Regarding reporting, do we have to have the forms on a separate page? A: This is what the specifications state, but you can deviate from this (showing both forms on the same page is ok). Remember to mention it in the documentation.

    Q: Regarding database and environmental variables, how should I check which ones to use? A: When e.g. running on Heroku, you could set an environmental variable to the Procfile that would help the app realize what environment is being used. Another option, as Heroku already provides an environmental variable DATABASE_URL, would be to check whether that exists, and -- if it does -- use that as the database url instead of other environmental variables. The working with databases part has a brief example about deploying an application that uses a database to Heroku -- mix this with the example on database configurations in the part on structuring web applications.

    Q: When running tests with an application that uses a connection pool, Deno (at times) complains about leaking resources. How can I handle this? A: It seems that the connection pool has not always been closed when the tests finish, and the tests do not wait for the connection pool to close. To allow leaking resources in tests, set sanitizeResources and sanitizeOps as false in tests, writing them in a bit more verbose way as follows:

Deno.test({
    name: "GET / returns 200", 
    async fn() {
        const testClient = await superoak(app);
        await testClient.get("/").expect(200);
    },
    sanitizeResources: false,
    sanitizeOps: false
});

Returning the project

A form for returning the project will be added here soon.
